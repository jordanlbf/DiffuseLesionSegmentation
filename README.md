# DiffuseLesionSegmentation
This repository contains the code and documentation for training and evaluating segmentation models, particularly focused on cutaneous neurofibroma (cNF) lesion segmentation. It includes scripts for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualisation of results. The project was trained on a confidential dataset which has been removed.
